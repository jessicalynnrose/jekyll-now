title: Week Ten- Starting our package
---

With a little over a month left in the course, it is time to start thinking about what I want to do for our final project. I have a couple different ideas that I want to pursue a little further before I decide on one and really dive deep into what I could do with it. I should have this completely decided by next week!

For now, we are practicing writing a DESCRIPTION file for the package. This contains information like what the package does, who created/maintains it and license along with other information. This is a very important file as it contains helpful information for others who may wish to use your package in the future.

My DESCRIPTION file example can be found [here](https://github.com/jessicalynnrose/Intro_to_R_Spring_2019/blob/master/DESCRIPTIONexample) on my GitHub.
