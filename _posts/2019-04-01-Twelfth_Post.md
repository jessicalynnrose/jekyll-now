title: Week Twelve- Markdown
---

The lesson for this week was to get familiar with Markdown. Lucky for myself, all of my blog posts so far have been created with Markdown! So for this one I'll just play around with all of the formatting features.

# Using the hastag
## symbol, you can make
### header's of
#### different
###### sizes!

You can also put *emphasis* on different **words** using combinations of ~~different characters~~.

To make lists you use:
1. numbers
* of asterisks
+ plus signs
- or minuses

You can include code in your file by using back-ticks.

`Your code goes here!`

Images can also be added to your markdown file
