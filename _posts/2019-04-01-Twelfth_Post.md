title: Week Twelve- Markdown
---

The lesson for this week was to get familiar with Markdown. Lucky for myself, all of my blog posts so far have been created with Markdown! So for this one I'll just play around with all of the formatting features.

# Using the hastag
## symbol, you can make
### header's of
#### different
###### sizes!

You can also put *emphasis* on different **words** using combinations of ~~different characters~~.

To make lists you use:
1. numbers
* of asterisks
+ plus signs
- or minuses

You can include code in your file by using back-ticks.

`Your code goes here!`

You can nclude images and web addresses in a similar manner using the following:

`![alternative_text](www.imageorwebsitehere.com)`

I use a image sharing site to host my pictures and then use the image links for showing pictures in my blog. I also use this for creating a link to my Github for each weeek's assignments. For example the code for this post can be found [here](https://github.com/jessicalynnrose/jessicalynnrose.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2019-04-01-Twelfth_Post.md).

I have found it very easy to learn how to use but it does have limitations in what it can do.
