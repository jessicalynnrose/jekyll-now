Thanks for checking out my blog! Read more about my background here!


My name is Jessica and I am studying for my Master's in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. I got my Bachelor's in Chemistry prior to starting my graduate program. The only formal programming class I have taken was MATLAB. I have recently started learning Python on my own as well as taking an Intro to R Programming class this semester. This blog will document my progress during Intro to R. Throughout the course of this semester I hope to develop my programming skills to help with my future career in Bioinformatics. Thanks for reading and feel free to email me if you have any questions!
