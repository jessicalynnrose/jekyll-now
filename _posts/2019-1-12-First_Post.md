Thanks for checking out my blog!

I'm really excited to begin learning how to program with R. The class is structured so we have prerecorded lectures, textbook reading and an assignment for each week. The textbooks we are using are The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design by Norman Matloff and R Package: Organize, Test, Document and Share Your Code by Hadley Wickham. In each of the posts, I'll be briefly mentioning what we learned that week as well walking through the process of completing the assignment with pictures of code. I have a link to my Github at the bottom of this blog and I will also be posting the code used to complete the assignment there!
